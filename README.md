NTL-Lunar-Mapping-and-Modeling-Portal
=====================================

The Lunar Mapping and Modeling Portal (LMMP) is a system that has been built to support lunar exploration activities that will enable return of both manned and unmanned missions to the Moon. It provides a web-based Portal and a suite of interactive visualization and analysis tools to enable mission planners, lunar scientists, and engineers to access mapped lunar data products from past and current lunar missions. It also addresses the lunar science community, the lunar commercial community, education and public outreach (E/PO), and anyone else interested in accessing or utilizing lunar data.

3)  It appears that the EC2 Security Group does NOT allow port 8181 to be
    accessed externally. Please make sure you are running a local tunnel
    from the command line like so:
