---------------
Build Setup
---------------

1) Modify build.properties. Ensure that pds.home points to the directory in which the PDS
   project is deployed. The Maven project expects ${pds.dir}/import_and_persistence to exist and to
   contains the NASA PDS/LMMP API Update.

-------------
DB Setup
-------------

1) Create a database in the target MySQL database and run the following create
   statement:
   
CREATE TABLE Job (uuid char(36) primary key, status varchar(20), hadoop_job_id varchar(100), fail_reason varchar(200), output_format varchar(10));

---------------------
Hadoop Env Setup
---------------------

These changes may be made in ~hadoop/.bash_profile -- REMEMBER TO source the
.bash_profile file!   

1) Ensure that HADOOP_HOME is set in the environment.

   This should be the same as YARN_HOME in the provided Topcoder VM. 
   
2) Ensure that HADOOP_CONF_DIR is set in the environment.

   In the Topcoder VM this should be set to ${HADOOP_HOME}/etc/hadoop, but it
   may (will) vary depending on your local setup, if not running in the VM.

-------------------------------
Java properties file setup
-------------------------------

0) File is at src/main/resources/lmmp.properties

1) If necessary modify the s3.* properties (they have been defaulted to the
   values provided in the TC forum thread
   http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=824230&start=0)
   
2) Set the jdbc.* properties: these establish the connection to the MySQL
   database.
   
3) The hadoop property is set to run the script above.
